This program is the classic Space Invaders arcade game created using Python. The objective of the game is to shoot all of the invaders before they get too close. This game includes the three main types of invaders as well as the special UFO that goes across the screen randomly. If you hit it, you get bonus points! The player can die by either being shot three times by the invaders or by the invaders getting too close to the player. The controls for the game include the left and right arrow keys to move, and the spacebar to shoot your lasers. I coded this project along with Clear Code so I could learn better strategies for code organization as well as class implementation, the video I went along with is here: https://youtu.be/o-6pADy5Mdg?si=vSa6aVYkrKVDelAf
